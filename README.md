# Machine learning using Python

Machine learning is a field of computer science that uses statistical techniques to give computer programs the ability to learn from past experiences and improve how they perform specific tasks.

In the the following tutorials, you will learn how to use machine learning tools and libraries to train your programs to recognise patterns and extract knowledge from data. You will learn how to use tools such as OpenCV, NumPy and TensorFlow for performing tasks such as data analysis, face recognition and speech recognition.

##  Index
According my to study.
1. Python Basic 
2. Numpy lib
3. Pandas lib
.. It will be updated according time
## Roadmap
This is the best roadmap I have ever seen to beginner who wants to be expert in ML.
1. Firstly:
I think to start in anything you must know the basic or general idea of ​​the field, so I list a few of the best videos I found that will give you a great first introduction of the terms you need to know to get started in the field.

- Learn the basics in a minute - What's AI - YouTube Playlist

2. Secondly:
Now you know a general idea in the field and it's the time to start Don't neglect the math or Statistics and probability ! we want to build a strong basic to be experts.

Here are some great beginner and advanced resources to get into machine learning maths:
- Linear Algebra - Khan Academy

- Statistics and probability - Khan Academy
(https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability)

- Multivariable Calculus - Khan Academy
(https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus)

3. Thirdly:
Now we have a strong knowledge in basics.. It's the time to start in the most powerful programming language to apply Machine learning (Python).

Here is a list of some great courses to learn the programming side of machine learning:
- Learn Python - Free interactive tutorial to learn python
(https://www.learnpython.org/)

- Learn Python Basics for Data Analysis - Free course on OpenClassrooms

- Python for Data Analysis - Datacamp
4. Fourthly:
It's the time to go to the exciting part (Mahcine Learning).

Here is a list of awesome courses available on YouTube that you should definitely follow and are 100% free:
- Introduction to machine learning - YouTube Playlist (Stanford)
(https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU)

- Intro to Machine Learning - Kaggle - Learn the core ideas in machine learning, and build your first models. - Free
